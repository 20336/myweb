		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I was born and rasied in Bryan, Ohio.
		I lived in one house for the first 10 years of my life,
		until I moved into the house I live in now.</p>
		<p>I'm typically quite and like to keep to myself for the most part, but after I really get to meet and talk to someone
		I tend to open up really fast and wil talk alot.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Family</h2>
		<p> My family consists of me, my mother, my father, my sister, and my four cats.<br /></p>
		<strong>My Mother</strong> -She is very quite and tends to not talk and jsut read her books. 
		Since she doesn't talk much and tends to give death glares at people on accident, my friends
		find her intimidating and scary.<br />
		<strong>My Father</strong> -He's a chill guy and fun to be around. He loves to watch and send me cat 
		videos. Another prominant thing he likes is reddit videos. <br /> 
		<strong>My Sister, Jaylyn</strong> -A little sister... She's kind of like me, minus the me.
		She tends to go out of the house a lot. When she is home she is usually in her room, keeping 
		to herself.<br />
		<strong>My Four Cats </strong>-<em>Ash</em>, <em>Shadow</em>, <em>Ponce</em>, and <em>Twig</em>.
				
		
		
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Video Games </strong>-My main hobbie is playing video games, it's something that keeps me entertained when 
			I have nothing else to do during the day. And, for the most part, I never have anything 
			to do during the day.<br /> When I get a game I like I basically become obsessed with it to the point where it will
			be the only game I will play for weeks even months. In the case of minecraft I was obsessed with that for a year, 
			and currently I've been obsessed with playing the Sims 4.<br /><br /> 
			<strong>Drawing </strong>-My second hobbie is drawing, I've been doing it since I was ten 
			and it is just something that tends to help get rid of my stress. Despite it being one of
			my main hobbies, I don't do it too often. <br />I can draw both digitally and traditionally, my main method is 
			traditional though. <br />Apart form drawing I also paint. I prefer oil painting and have done. <br />What I like to
			draw really changes based on my moods, though I typically like to draw characters, I also like to draw things that
			I think will get a reaction out of people like gore and other things similar to that.</p>
