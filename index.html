		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I was born and rasied in Bryan, Ohio.
		I lived in one house for the first 10 years of my life,
		until I moved into the house I live in now.</p>
		<p>I'm typically quiet and like to keep to myself for the most part, but after I really get to meet and talk to someone
		I tend to open up really fast and will talk a lot. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<h2>Family</h2>
		<p> My family consists of me, my mother, my father, and my sister.<br /><br />
		<strong>My Mother</strong> -She is very quiet and tends to not talk and just read her books. 
		Since she doesn't talk much and tends to give death glares at people on accident, my friends
		find her intimidating and scary.<br />
		<strong>My Father</strong> -He's a chill guy and fun to be around. He loves to watch and send me cat 
		videos. Another prominant thing he likes is reddit videos. <br /> 
		<strong>My Sister, Jaylyn</strong> -A little sister... She's kind of like me, minus the me.
		She tends to go out of the house a lot. When she is home she is usually in her room, keeping 
		to herself.<br /></p>

		<h2>Cats</h2>
		<p>Cat are my favorite house pet to have. I've had cats throughout my whole childhood and still have some.<br/>
		The most I've had at one time was 12, though most were kittens, they all had names. I currently only have 
		5 cats: 6 inside cats and 2 inside-outside cats</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ash </strong>- A playful, yet stern cat, he's all gray with a patch of white on his 
				abdomen. He likes to jump on the back of my chair if I have chips or crackers and won't leave until 
				he gets some.</li>
				<li><strong>Shadow </strong>- A very shy, all black cat. He is sort of fat and balding. He is treated 
				like the baby of all of the cats, because he is everyone's favorite. He will come to my bedroom door and 
				meow until I take him to the bathroom because he doesn't like to go alone.</li>
				<li><strong>Ponce </strong>- A black and white cat, named after the Spanish explorer and conquistador, 
				Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. He is a cat that you love and hate. He is a loving cat, and will still be friendly 
				even if you put him through a meat grinder and reshape him.</li>
				<li><strong>Twig </strong>- A tabby cat. She has made all the other cats hate her because she is so 
				bi-polar. That's the best way <strong>I</strong> could describe her, but my family uses some unsavory 
				words when describing her.</li>
				<li><strong>Mom/Ma/Mamas </strong>- Another tabby cat, she is the mother of Ponce and Twig.
				She has had 3 litters total. Her first litter was Ponce and Twig, her second was a litter of 4 kittens,
				and her most recent litter was 7 kittens.</li>
				<li><strong>Trouble </strong>- Tabby kitten, she is like a smaller verions of the mom cat. Her and
				Princess are from the same litter.</li>
				<li><strong>Princess </strong>- Another tabby kitten, she is like a smaller verions of Twig. She is a little
				thief and likes to take things from my room out into the kitchen.</li>
				<li><strong>Stevie/Steven </strong>- Another tabby cat, she is the youngest. Everyone loves her because 
				she is so small and aborable.</li>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Video Games </strong>- My main hobby is playing video games, it's something that keeps me entertained when 
			I have nothing else to do during the day. And, for the most part, I never have anything 
			to do during the day.<br /> When I get a game I like I basically become obsessed with it to the point where it will
			be the only game I will play for weeks even months. In the case of Minecraft I was obsessed with that for a year, 
			and currently I've been obsessed with playing the Sims 4.<br /><br /> </p>
			<p><strong>Drawing </strong>- My second hobby is drawing, I've been doing it since I was ten 
			and it is just something that tends to help get rid of my stress. Despite it being one of
			my main hobbies, I don't do it too often. <br />I can draw both digitally and traditionally, my main method is 
			traditional though. <br />Apart from drawing I also paint. I prefer oil painting and have done. <br />What I like to
			draw really changes based on my moods, though I typically like to draw characters. I also like to draw things that
			I think will get a reaction out of people like gore and other things similar to that.</p>
