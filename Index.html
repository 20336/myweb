		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			My main hobbie is playing video games, it's something that keeps me entertained when 
			I have nothing else to do during the day. And, for the most part, I never have anything 
			to do during the day<br /><br />
			My second hobbie is drawing, I've been doing it since I was ten and it is just something
			that tends to help get rid of my stress. Despite it being one of my main hobbies, I don't
			do it too often.<br />
