		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I was born and rasied in Bryan, Ohio.
		I lived in one house for the first 10 years of my life,
		until I moved into the house I live in now.</p>
		<p>I'm typically quite and like to keep to myself for the most part</p>
		
		
		<h2>Family</h2>
		<p> My family consists of me, my mother, my father, my sister, and my four cats.<br /></p>
		<strong>My Mother</strong> -Short, yet intimidating woman, doesn't talk much.<br />
		<strong>My Father</strong> -Chill, funny guy who loves cat and reddit videos.<br /> 
		<strong>My Sister, Jaylyn</strong> -An little sister... She's kind of like me, minus the me.<br />
		<strong>My Four Cats </strong>-Ash, Shadow, Ponce, and Twig.
				
		
		
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			My main hobbie is playing video games, it's something that keeps me entertained when 
			I have nothing else to do during the day. And, for the most part, I never have anything 
			to do during the day<br /><br />
			<strong>Drawing </strong>-My second hobbie is drawing, I've been doing it since I was ten and it is just something
			that tends to help get rid of my stress. Despite it being one of my main hobbies, I don't
			do it too often.<br />
